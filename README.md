# Blackcoffer-Sentiment-Analysis
A NLP Sentiment project aims to conduct a comprehensive linguistic and sentiment analysis of web pages by scraping and examining their textual content. For each webpage, various measures will be calculated to gain insights into the nature and characteristics of the text. These measures include the total length of the text, counts of positive and negative words based on a predefined lexicon, overall sentiment, and polarity score. Additionally, the readability and complexity of the text will be assessed through metrics such as the average sentence length, percentage of complex words, Fog Index, and syllable-related measures. The analysis will also consider word count, personal pronoun usage, and average word length. This multifaceted approach will provide a detailed understanding of the linguistic and emotional attributes of the web content, offering valuable insights for various applications.
